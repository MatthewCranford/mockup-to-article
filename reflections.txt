Your response goes here!

1. What new skills have I learned? 
- I've learned about different types of elements and how to use them, such as <strike>, <sup>, <i>, <bold>, <emp>, <strong>, and <cite>. 

2. What has been easy?
- Structuring pages with HTML.

3. What has been difficult?
- Remembering the different semantic meaning of emp, strong, i, and bold.

4. How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
- I break the problem down into small pieces. First I complete what I find easy, then I take what I find difficult one section at a time. When I get stuck or forget the syntax I use MDN, W3, or stackoverflow to find my answers.
